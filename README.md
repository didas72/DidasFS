# DidasFS

This is my second attempt at makign a file system after an adandoned project in C#. This new version, written in C, has a similar structure. <br> I'll use it as a means to better understand functioning of systems like FAT to find their limitations to, in a future project, attempt to remove them.

## Documentation

You can find the specifications for the system under `doc/DataStructures.md`.
