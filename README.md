# DidasFS

This is my second attempt at making a file system, after an abandoned project in C#. This new version, written in C, maintains the same working principle but was implemented and documented more seriously.  
I'll use it as a means to better understand the functioning of file systems. After completing it, I plan on analysing it's biggest problems and limitations and design a new one to hopefully improve on the design.

## Disclaimer

This file system is experimental and lacks a lot of features most FSes have. I haven't finished implementing it yet, and even when I do, it WILL be missing features, since they were purposefully not included in the specification. These include but are not limited to file ownership, group permissions and links.

## Documentation

You can find the specifications for the system under `doc/DataStructures.md`.
More documentation can be generated by running `make doc` or `doxygen Doxyfile`.

## Dependencies

This filesystem implementation was written to work with Linux and to be build with gcc. To generate part of the docs you will need `doxygen`.
